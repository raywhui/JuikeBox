## Getting Started	

You'll need a refined taste for alcohol. Or just any alcohol for that matter. You'll also need real life ingredients if you plan on making any actual drinks.

### Prerequisites

You must be 21+ years old in order to legally drink alocohol in the US.

```
GOVERNMENT WARNING:
(1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or 
operate machinery, and may cause health problems. Please drink responsibly.
```

### How It Works

When you are prompted to the ingredients page, you can input the ingredients that you wish to use in your drink. The search engine will auto generate a list of ingredients for you based on what you type. Simply click on what you want to add to your drink, and it will appear in the left box. Continue to do this until you have a minimum of 2 ingredients, then click on the shaker and it will being to generate a drink for you based on the ingredients you have given.

There are currently two options to choose from when deciding your ingredients: "Exact Ingredients" and "I'll go buy the rest". "Exact Ingredients" will generate drinks solely based on the ingredients you have selected. If a drink does not currently exist with the list you have given, you will be prompted to reinput a new list of ingredients. "I'll go buy the rest" is an option for those who are willing to run outside during a party to buy the last few ingredients they didn't know they needed to make a great drink. This option will generate drinks with ingredients you have no explicitly listed, just close enough. It pretty much does the same thing as the first option, but a little more flexible when it comes to the ingredients.

After you have clicked the shaker, you will be prompted to the next screen which will give you instructions on how to create the drink. Just follow the step by step instructions and you should be just fine, assuming you are not already drunk. Sometimes, there will also be a list of other drinks that contain the same ingredients if you wanna try those instead. Once that's done, click on the receipt and you will be lead to the receipt page.

On the receipt page, you will be given a name for the drink you made, a price (inflated because bar drinks are expensive), and a picture of what it should look like! There is also a song suggestion on the side of the screen so you can enjoy your drink and listen to new music at the same time!

If you wish to create a new drink, simply click on the green tab on the right hand side and it will take you back to the ingredients page, where you can make a new drink all over again. Enjoy!
